# EXERCISE: display the french week, one day, per line, but just show the first
# two letters of each day. So the output should look like this:
# Lu
# Ma
# Me

# Reminder: we can "concatenate" strings with + , for instance:
firstname = "Jérôme"
lastname = "Petazzoni"
fullname = firstname + " " + lastname
print(fullname)

# We can concatenate in a for loop by "accumulating" in a variable.
# For instance:
all_the_days = ""
for day in week:
  all_the_days = all_the_days + day

# EXERCISE: the example in the previous cell did put all the days mushed together.
# Write code so that the days are separated by a space, like this:
# Monday Tuesday Wednesday etc.

# EXERCISE: generate a string with the first letter of each day of the week of the French week.
# So, that should be: LMMJVSD
@@@
# EXERCISE: generate a string with the first 3 letters of each day of the English week, separated by spaces.
# So, the string should be: Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun

# We can check if a string is in another string with "in".
# Example:
lastname = "Petazzoni"
print("taz" in lastname) # prints True
print("haha" in lastname) # prints False
if "zo" in lastname:
  print("zo is in lastname")
else:
  print("zo is NOT in lastname")

# We can get the first letters of a string like this:
alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
first_three_letters = alphabet[:3]
# But we can also get the last letters like this:
last_four_letters = alphabet[-4:]

print(last_four_letters)
# ⚠️ PAY ATTENTION to the position of the ":"
# when we want the first X letters, it is [:X]
# when we want the last X letters, it is [-X:]

# EXERCISE: print the days of the french week that finish with "di"
