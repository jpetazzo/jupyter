# EXERCISE:
# 1) put your first name in a variable
# 2) put your last name in a variable
# 3) define a third variable that will have your full name, but like this:
# "Petazzoni, Jérôme" (last name - comma - space - first name)
# 4) print that variable

# EXERCISE: print the first 3 letters of each day of the week.

# Mon
# Tue

# By using a "for loop", we can repeat a given piece of code multiple times.
# For instance:
print("this is executed only once, before the for loop")
for day in week:
  print("we are now within the for loop, this will be shown once per day")
  print("the day is: " + day)
print("this is executed only once, after the for loop")

# EXERCISE: print the first 3 letters of each day of the week,
# by using a for loop so that the code is more concise.
# If you already used a for loop in the previous exdercise, congrats!
